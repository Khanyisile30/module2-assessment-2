<p>Adrift in space with no food or water, Tony Stark sends a message to 
    Pepper Potts as his oxygen supply starts to dwindle. 
    Meanwhile, the remaining Avengers -- Thor, Black Widow,
    Captain America and Bruce Banner -- must figure out a way to bring back 
    their vanquished allies for an epic showdown with Thanos --
     the evil demigod who decimated the planet and the universe.
    </p>
 <p>After Thanos, an intergalactic warlord, disintegrates half of the universe,
the Avengers must reunite and assemble again toreinvigorate their trounced allies and 
restore balance.'Avengers: Endgame' is a meditation on time – and it leaves us 
with a fittingly age-old message: that we should cherish the moments we have on this earth with our loved ones. As Tony Stark puts it, quoting his father to his father,
 “No amount of money ever bought a second of time.</p>
